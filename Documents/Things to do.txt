1. First thing I will check if the DML is working.  I will let you know once done.  No need for Unit Testing as we have done it exhausitively.  
2. We can have Validation and Error handling, may be for one or two methods and a global Error Handling.
3. After this go with GitHub and Dockers
4. After these Kubernates
5. Let us create the UI next
6. CI/CD the very last step
