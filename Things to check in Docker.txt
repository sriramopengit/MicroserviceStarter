Things to check in Docker
==========================

ðŸ“¦ Additional (Optional) Docker Topics You Could Explore:
These arenâ€™t strictly required, but useful depending on how deep you want to go:

1. Health Checks in Docker Compose
You can add healthcheck: for services like SQL Server to ensure dependent services only start when DB is really ready.

2. Multi-Stage Builds for .NET
Optimizing Dockerfile size and performance:

3. Docker Secrets and Sensitive Data
For production, avoid putting passwords in docker-compose.yml. Use secrets or .env files.

4. Custom Docker Networks
Youâ€™re already using user-defined bridge networks â€” but you could explore network aliases or overlay networks (used in Swarm).

5. Docker Compose Override Files
Use docker-compose.override.yml to tweak things in development without modifying the main file.

6. Bind Mounts for Local Development
This allows you to sync code between your host and container for live development.

7. Image Caching & Layer Optimization
Ordering your Dockerfile commands wisely for cache efficiency.

8. Container Logs, Metrics, Monitoring
Use:

docker logs

docker stats

Integrate with ELK, Prometheus, etc.

9. Docker Swarm (Basic Cluster Mode)
A simple alternative to Kubernetes for orchestration.

10. Exporting/Importing Docker Images

docker save -o myimage.tar imagename
docker load -i myimage.tar

ðŸš€ What Comes Next?
Since youâ€™ve mastered Docker for Microservices:

âœ… Kubernetes (Helm, kubectl, manifests, services, ingress)

âœ… CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.)

âœ… API Gateway & Service Discovery

âœ… Observability (OpenTelemetry, distributed tracing)

CI/CD (GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps)

Cloud deployments (Azure, AWS, etc.)

Monitoring & logging (e.g., Prometheus, ELK stack)
